# 1. Installation

## 1.1 Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3.git
cd haddock3
cd src/fcc/src
chmod u+x Makefile
./Makefile
cd -
```

## 1.2 Create a virtual environment with Python 3.8+ and install dependencies:
### with `venv`

```bash
virtualenv-3.8 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop --no-deps
```

### with `conda`
```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate haddock3
python setup.py develop --no-deps
```

## 1.3 Make a CNS binary shortcut to the expected path:

```bash
mkdir -p bin/

# on mac
ln -s /PATH/TO/cns_solve-1.31-UU-MacIntel.exe bin/cns

# on linux
ln -s /PATH/TO/CNS_FOLDER/intel-x86_64bit-linux/source/cns_solve-2002171359.exe bin/cns
```

## 1.4 Keep up to date

In the `github` folder of `haddock3` run:

```bash
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

This will pull the latest changes to your local folder and because you
installed `haddock3` with the option `develop` those changes become
available immediately.

# Installing third-party packages

HADDOCK3 is able to integrate third-party software in its workflows.
However, we are not responsible to the proper installation of such
packages, but we do help you to install them. Bellow, you will find a
list of all third-party packages HADDOCK3 can use and guidelines for
their proper installation.

## `lightdock`

To install to [lightdock](https://github.com/lightdock/lightdock) follow
the instructions in the project's website. Remember to install it under
the same Python environment you created for HADDOCK3. If you have any
doubts, please let us know.

## `gdock`

1. Clone the latest version:

```
cd some-folder
git clone https://github.com/rvhonorato/gdock.git
```

2. Install Python3+ dependencies
```
pip install deap scipy mgzip biopython
```

3. Set `GDOCK_PATH`
```
export GDOCK_PATH=some-folder
```

**Important**: These are not the full `gdock`'s installation
instructions as here only the model generation is used. Please check the
