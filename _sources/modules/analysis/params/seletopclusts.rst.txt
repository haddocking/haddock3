sortby
~~~~~~

| *default*: 'score'
| *type*: string
| *title*: Method used to define `best cluster`.
| *short description*: Best cluster can be defined based either on cluster models scores, or on cluster size. By default, 'score' is selected.
| *long description*: if the selection is done by 'score' the average score of the top (4) models of each cluster is used to define the cluster rank. When clustering by 'size', a bigger cluster size corresponds to a higher rank. By default, 'score' is selected.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

top_clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 1000
| *type*: integer
| *title*: Number of clusters to consider
| *min*: 1
| *max*: 99999
| *short description*: Number of clusters to consider (ranked by score)
| *long description*: Number of clusters to consider (ranked by score)
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

top_models
~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 10
| *type*: integer
| *title*: Number of best-ranked models to select per cluster
| *min*: 1
| *max*: 99999
| *short description*: Number of best-ranked models to select per cluster. By default, 10 models are selected.
| *long description*: Number of best-ranked models to select per cluster. By default, 10 models are selected. If one expects to find many clusters (e.g., in the case of vague restraints), this number can be reduced to speed up the protocol. Instead, if few clusters are expected (very specific and localized restraints) this number can be increased.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy
