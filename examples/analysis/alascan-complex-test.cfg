# ==================================================
#           Alanine Scan with HADDOCK3
#
#  This example workflow will perform alanine scanning
#  on an antibody-protein complex using HADDOCK3.
#  The workflow will focus on the antibody side of the
#  complex and will generate a series of mutants by
#  replacing each residue by alanine and glycine.
