  title: Tries to correct input PDBs
  short: If true, evaluates and tries to correct the input PDB before the
    workflow.
  long: HADDOCK3 checks and processes the input PDB files to ensure they
    all comply with HADDOCK3's requirements. These checks concerns, for example,
    residue numbering, compatibility of chain IDs, and many others. You can see
    all checks performs in the live issue
    https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/143. If set to false, no
    checks are performed and HADDOCK3 directly uses the original input PDBs.
