  title: Tries to correct input PDBs
  short: If true, evaluates and tries to correct the input PDB before the
    workflow.
  long: HADDOCK3 checks and processes the input PDB files to ensure they
    all comply with HADDOCK3's requirements. These checks concerns, for example,
    residue numbering, compatibility of chain IDs, and many others. You can see
    all checks performs in the live issue
    https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/143. If set to false, no
    checks are performed and HADDOCK3 directly uses the original input PDBs.

  title: Executes haddock3-analyse on the CAPRI folders at the end of the run
  short: If true, executes haddock3-analyse on the CAPRI folders at the end of 
    the workflow
  long: haddock3-analyse is a cli (see https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/src/haddock/clis/cli_analyse.py)
    used to plot the results of a HADDOCK3 workflow. If this option, this command
    is automatically executed at the end of the workflow (on the caprieval folders).
