  default: []
  type: list

  title: List of residues to be mutated
  short: List of residues to be mutated. By default all the interface residues are
    mutated.
  long: List of residues to be mutated. By default all the interface residues are
    mutated. resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A,
    resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain
    identifier.

  title: Dump the input models with the rescaled delta_score written in the b-factor column.
  short: Dump the input models with the rescaled delta_score written in the b-factor column. 
  long: Dump the input models with the rescaled delta_score written in the b-factor column. Those files do not contain the mutations, but rather will display the normalized (between 0 and 100) delta HADDOCK score (100 * (delta_score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)) in the b-factor column. The higher the b-factor, the more favourable (or less unfavourable) the mutation. You can color the PDB files according to this attribute (in pymol, type "spectrum b")

  short: Dump the mutated, energy-minimized PDB files.
  long: Dump the mutated, energy-minimized PDB files. As the number of mutants can be very large, this option is allowed only when a single model is provided in input.
