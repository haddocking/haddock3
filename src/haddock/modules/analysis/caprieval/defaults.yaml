  title: Calculate I-RMSD
  short: Performs Interface RMSD calculations.
  long: Calculates the Interface Root Mean Square Deviation.
    This calculate the RMSD of interface backbone atoms after fitting on the interface backbone atoms.
    The interface is idenfied based on intermolecular contacts shorter than the defined irmsd_cutoff.

  title: Calculate FNAT
  short: Performs FNAT calculations.
  long: Calculates the Fraction of Native Contacts. This evaluates how many contacts observed
    in the reference are present in the model. The distance cutoff used to define intermolecular contacts is
    defined by the fnat_cutoff parameter.

lrmsd:
  default: true
  type: boolean
  title: Calculate L-RMSD
  short: Performs Ligand RMSD calculations.
  long: Calculates the Ligand Root Mean Square Deviation. This calculation is done by superimposing
    the receptors (defined by the receptor_chain parameter) and then evaluating the RMSD on the ligands (defined by the ligand_chains parameter). 
    Superposition and RMSD calculations are done on backbone heavy atoms.

  title: Calculate I-L-RMSD
  short: Performs Interface Ligand RMSD calculations.
  long: Calculates the Interface Ligand Root Mean Square Deviation. This calculation is done by superimposing the model and the target
        on the interface backbone atoms of the receptor (defined by the receptor_chain parameter) and calculating the RMSD on all heavy atoms 
        of the ligand (defined by the ligand_chains parameter).

global_rmsd:
  default: true
  type: boolean
  title: Calculate global RMSD
  short: Calculate full structure RMSD.
  long: Compute full structure RMSD between reference structure and the model
        after superimposition. Note that a sequence alignment is performed to
        obtain the mapping between the reference and the model. If the one of
        the structure contain a 'small-molecule', we assume that the compared
        structure atoms are in the same order. With default parameters `allatoms = false`, only
        backbone RMSD will be computed.
