  title: Relative path to contact_fcc executable.
  short: Relative path to contact_fcc executable.
  long: As contact_fcc is an external tool, its path must be provided. Basically, this parameter should not be changed, as the tool is downloaded at the same time as haddock3. Nevertheless, one could try to have the contact_fcc tool written in another programming language or whatever.

  title: Cutoff distance (A) for contact detection.
  short: Cutoff distance (A) for contact detection. By default 5.0 Angstroms.

  title: Minimum fraction of common contacts to be considered in a cluster.
  short: Minimum fraction of common contacts to be considered in a cluster. By default 0.6.
  long: Minimum fraction of common contacts (fcc) to cluster complexes together. Complexes not sharing fraction of common contacts above the `fraction_cutoff` parameter cannot belong to the same cluster.

min_population:

  type: integer
  min: 1
  max: 9999
  title: Clustering population threshold.
  short: Threshold employed to exclude clusters with less than this number of members. By default 4.
  long: Minimum set of grouped complexes to define a cluster. If a potential cluster is composed of less than this number of members, it will be considered as `singleton` and discarded from final clusters. If set to 1, all complexes will be part of a cluster. By default 4.

  title: Strictness factor.
  short: Strictness factor. It's multiplied by the fraction_cutoff to obtain a new cutoff for the second half of the matrix. By default 0.75.
  long: Strictness factor. It's multiplied by the fraction_cutoff to obtain a new cutoff for the second half of the matrix. Used to allow for some variability. By default 0.75.
