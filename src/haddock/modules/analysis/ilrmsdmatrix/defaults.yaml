receptor_chain:
  default: A
  type: string

  title: Receptor ChainID
  short: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations.
  long: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations. This determines which chain will be
    treated as the receptor for the L-RMSD and for I-L-RMSD.

  title: Ligand ChainIDs
  short: Ligand ChainIDs to be considered for the IL-RMSD calculations.
  long: Ligand ChainIDs to be considered for the IL-RMSD calculations. This determines which chains will be
    treated as the ligand for the IL-RMSD. By default, all chains are considered with the exception of the receptor chain.

  type: integer
  min: 1
  max: 20000
  title: Maximum number of models
  short: Maximum number of models to be considered when calculating the matrix.
  long: Maximum number of models to be considered when calculating the matrix. If the number of models in the input file is larger than
    this number, the execution will be aborted.

atom_similarity:
  default: 90.0
  type: float
  min: 10.0
  max: 100.0
  precision: 3
  title: Required atom similarity
  short: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models.
  long: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models. If the similarity is higher than this value, the RMSD calculation is performed on the common atoms. Otherwise, the calculation is stopped. The lower the value the looser the checks.

  default: false
  type: boolean
  title: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
  short: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
  long: Atoms to be considered during the analysis. If false (default), only
        backbone atoms will be considered, otherwise all the heavy-atoms.

  type: float

  title: Distance cutoff defining a contact.
  short: Cutoff distance (in Angstrom) defining a contact.
  long: Distance (in Angstrom) cutoff defining a contact. Any atoms within this
        cutoff range will be used to define the interface. Standard values are 
        usually 3.9 A or 5.0 A.
