max_models:
  default: 10000
  type: integer
  min: 1
  max: 20000
  title: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
  short: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
  long: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of
    the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU
    and disk space.

resdic_:
  default: []
  type: list
  minitems: 0
  maxitems: 100
  title: List of residues
  short: The residue numbers that should be used in the alignment and in the
    RMSD calculation.
  long: resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A,
    resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain
    identifier.

atom_similarity:
  default: 90.0
  type: float
  min: 10.0
  max: 100.0
  precision: 3
  title: Required atom similarity
  short: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models.
  long: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models. If the similarity is higher than this value, the RMSD calculation is performed on the common atoms. Otherwise, the calculation is stopped. The lower the value the looser the checks.

allatoms:
  default: false
  type: boolean
  title: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
  short: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
  long: Atoms to be considered during the analysis. If false (default), only
        backbone atoms will be considered, otherwise all the heavy-atoms.
