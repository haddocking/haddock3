    This allows HADDOCK to operate in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints can also

    geometrical centers of the various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini coarse-grained
    molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands, all atoms will be used to define the geometric center.

    resulting in tighter distance restraints.
  long: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined for the center of mass restraints between molecules.
    Each molecule is oriented along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
    If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its smallest two half dimensions. 
    If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its three half dimensions..
    In case of DNA or small ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0.
    The effective upper distance limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule distances.

  title: Number of semi-flexible segments
  short: This defines the number of semi-flexible segments (-1 automatic, 0 ridig, >1 manual definition). 
  long: This parameter defines the number of semi-flexible segments for the specified molecule.
    If set to -1 then those are automatically defined based on contacts. Those can also be manually defined by defining the number of segment (nseg>=1).
    In that case the starting and ending residues of each segment must be defined. The position of atoms in regions outside the semi-flexible regions
    will have weak harmonic positional restraints during the energy minimisation. If nseg is set to 0, then the molecule will be kept ridig.
