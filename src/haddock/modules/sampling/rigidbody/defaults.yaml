    The fraction of restraints randomly removed depends on the npart parameter which defines in how many sets the restraints should be randomly split.

cmrest:
  default: false
  type: boolean
  title: Center of mass restraints
  short: Automatically defines distance restraints between the geometric center of the various molecules.
  long: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of mass restraints between the various molecules. 
    This allows HADDOCK to operate in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints can also
    be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions. The distance restraints are defined between the 
    geometrical centers of the various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini coarse-grained
    molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands, all atoms will be used to define the geometric center.
    The upper limit distance is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see cmtight description).
  group: 'ab initio mode'

cmtight:
  default: true
  type: boolean
  title: Center of mass restraint tightness
  short: Defines the upper distance limit based on the sum of the average dimension of the two molecule, 
    if cmtight=false all three dimensions are used, if set to true the shortest two only are used, 
    resulting in tighter distance restraints.
  long: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined for the center of mass restraints between molecules.
    Each molecule is oriented along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
    If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its smallest two half dimensions. 
    If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its three half dimensions..
    In case of DNA or small ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0.
    The effective upper distance limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule distances.

  short: Ambiguous interaction restraints will be defined randomly from surface patches around solvent accessible residues.
  long: When turned on, this option will automatically define ambigous interaction restraints between the various molecules 
    from randomly selected surface patches from solvent accessible residues . 
    This allows HADDOCK to operate in ab-initio mode. 
    Note that this type of restraints can not be combined with any other distance restraints. 
    By default the entire surface will be sampled, but it is possible to define per molecule segments 
    from which the random restraints will be defined (see the nrair_X parameter).
