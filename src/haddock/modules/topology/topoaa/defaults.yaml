  title: Automatic HIS protonation state
  short: 'The protonation state of histidine (+1: HIS or 0: HISD/HISE) will be automatically
    set by HADDOCK'

    histidines ((+1: HIS or 0: HISD/HISE) by selecting the state leading to the lowest
    electrostatic energy'

delenph:
  default: true
  type: boolean
  title: Keep or remove non-polar hydrogen atoms
  short: If set to true, non-polar hydrogen atoms will be discarded to save computing
    time
  long: Since HADDOCK uses a united atom force field, the non-polar hydrogen atoms
    can be in principle discarded. This saves computing time. However this should
    not be done if you are defining distance restraints to specific hydrogen atoms
    (e.g. when using NMR distance restraints).

    Setting the limit to false is useful when the topoaa module is followed by
    scoring modules such as emscoring, or other analysis modules. If topoaa is
    used in the middle of the workflow this parameter has no effect.
